# MJRoBot-Web-RPi-Robot
Those are the HTML Pages and scrips used on the "Web controlled Robot based on Raspberry Pi" project.

The project was divided in two parts and published as Instructables:

http://www.instructables.com/id/IoT-Controlling-a-Raspberry-Pi-Robot-Over-Internet/
In this instructable, we will create a fully controlled IoT Raspberry Pi Robot. The idea is to control the robot (or anything), using low level commands written with shell scripts commanded straight from the HTML page. Not using higher level languages as Python for example, makes the robot very responsive and quick to act.

This 1st part of the project will cover "how to":

a) Install and use the WiringPi library to control the RPi's GPIOs; 
b) Control motors using an H-Bridge; 
c) Make the RPi a WebServer; 
d) Create a HTML to control the robot over internet; 

If you want to go further and provide your robot with "vision", you can go to the second part of this tutorial:

http://www.instructables.com/id/IoT-Raspberry-Pi-Video-Streamer-and-PanTilt-Camera/

There, we will cover:

a) How to stream video with a PiCam; 
b) How to install and use ServoBlaster library; 
c) How to control servo motors and build a PAM/TILT camera position mechanism; 
d) Create a HTML page to control the camera position over the internet;
